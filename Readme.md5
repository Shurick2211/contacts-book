Back-end

We need a Spring Boot + Kotlin app with an API to receive incoming calls from Android apps.
Use Swagger for autogenerated API documentation.
The app will collect and store customers' data. It should allow to receive
and process JSON requests with the following params:
First name
Last name
Phone number
Email
App
Date (default = now)
The new app should validate phone numbers (length, format) and emails.
Valid contacts should be added to our database and checked for a duplicate.
If the new contact has invalid data, the app should send an error code and
message with an error description. For example, you should ask senders to
correct the phone number and email. We also need an API to search for
collected customers by phone numbers or emails.
